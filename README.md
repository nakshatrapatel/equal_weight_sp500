# Equal Weight S&P 500
The following repository contains a project I did with guidance from @nickmccullum and his "Algorithmic Trading Using Python" course on youtube.  <br>
I have taken the initiative to make my own changes: <br>
-- When looping through the stocks, to make the code more versatile for someone who doesn't have access to an updated list of the S&P500, 
I have implemented a try and except block. <br>
-- I have also used reccursion to ensure the code repeats itself until the user inputs a number when asked how much they want to invest. <br>
